# Week X Problem Set (CS50)

## What I Learned
- Basic syntax in C
- Loop, conditional, function
- Simple debugging and handling data types

## Challenges I Faced
- It was harsh at first, to meet with C's strict rules
- Keeping all program logic in head is difficult, so I started using notebook and pseudocode

## What I Enjoyed
- I really enjoy inventing solutions for the problems
- Especially when they are working!

## Looking Ahead
Looking forward to continue my programming journey!
